Unfortunately, after failing to contribute to the kernel through the patches aimed at resolving improper memory access, and given that we have not yet received any feedback on the third patch, along with the fact that the changes made in Git were relatively minor, I found myself compelled to return and attempt to contribute once again to the kernel. I truly enjoyed being part of this environment and community, and I would like to try contributing, even if only in a small way. To achieve this, I decided to shift my focus to a relatively simpler problem, yet still quite important: refactoring and resolving duplicated code within the kernel.

> This post is to report our first contributions and interactions with Open Source Development, first started as an assignment on the [Open Source development class](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=MAC0470&codcur=3122&codhab=5000), at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, advised by professor [Paulo Meirelles](https://www.ime.usp.br/~paulormm/).
